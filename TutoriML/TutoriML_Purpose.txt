TutoriML puropse/outline

In the spirit of markdown, TutoriML is a tool designed to simplify the development of tutorial content for web-based software development guides.
It is built under the premise that every page of the tutorial document contains two categories of content:
	Explanitory text
	Example code
Certain portions of the example code would often be written inline with the text, but large blocks may be presented in a separate element, such as a textbox.
This would definitely be the case for interactive sites, where the user could add to the example code and experiment within the web interface.
More often than not, as one progresses through the tutorial, most of the code remains the same while portions are added or replaced.
TutoriML helps provide this functionality within a web application by parsing the .tml document and dividing it into slides.
Each slide contains at least a "content" block.  This is the explanitory text, written in markdown, that will appear on the website.
Most slides will contain at least one "code" block with one of the following modify insructions:
	codeset
	codeappend
	codeprepend
	codereplace
